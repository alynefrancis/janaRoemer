			<p>It is such an honour to team up with Elena for this retreat. She has influenced myself and thousands around the world in all the right ways, including introducing me to my husband. Now I get to introduce you to her. I am forever in awe of this woman.</p>
 
			<p>Elena Brower is a mother, an author, a teacher, and co-owner of Virayoga in NYC, a destination studio for travelers and New Yorkers alike. Her first book, Art of Attention, an artful yoga workbook, is in its second US printing and its second translation. Influenced by alignment-based Hatha, Kundalini and Yin yoga, Elena offers yoga as a way to approach our world with realistic reverence and gratitude. She is always honoured to collaborate with fellow teachers and thought-leaders, and her classes are a masterful, candid blend of alignment and attention cues that speak to body, mind, and heart.</p> 
 
			<p>As an Executive Producer of On Meditation, she's helping curate a film that takes us into the lives of meditators to introduce and inspire practice. Writing can be found on Huffington Post, Positively Positive and Elephant Journal, and classes can be found on YogaGlo.</p>
