			<h1>Jana Roemer</h1>
			<h2>Life is about learning to fall in love with everything.</h2>
		</header>
		<div class="bio opacity2">
			<p><span>Jana</span> is a fun-loving, playful creature, perpetually <span>hunting for understanding & truth</span> as she travels across the globe. Her passion for this ancient practice fuels her creative desire to make it contemporary & <span>keep it real</span>. She is blessed to have had a steady mentor and studied with many great  teachers; however, her current, <span>most profound Spiritual teacher</span> is the love and intimate mirror she's found in her husband, Mark Roemer.</p>
			 
			<p>Jana's yogic training began long before ever stepping foot on a yoga mat. <span>Growing up</span> in small town Saskatchewan with little more than her imagination to keep her company, Jana's fascination with the physical and the ethereal flourished as she spent many years silently watching the behavour of the pelicans, beavers, deer, turtles, snakes, owls and other animals that inhabited her back yard. Her favourite perch was either on the edge of a river or flat on her back in an open meadow staring at the stars. Looking back this may have been her <span>first experience of meditation</span> as she clearly remembers as a young kid contemplating questions like "Why am I here?" and "Where did I come from?"</p> 
			 
			<p><span>She is a traveler</span>. She has navigated the deep silence of the Peruvian desert to the cantankerous, cow-lined streets of India and many places in between. Most often, she finds herself seeking the small towns and uninhabited spaces over the crowed cities in the countries she visits. These experiences fuel her love and reverence for the sheer majesty of Gaia, Mother Earth.</p>
			 
			<p>Blessed with a supportive and loving family, Jana's <span>thirst for knowledge</span> to satisfy both her orderly mathematical mind and esoteric inclinations lead to her to obtain a Bachelor of Commerce from the University of Saskatchewan. This is where she had her first taste of Yoga Philosophy in 2001. She related to this way of living, yet it took her until 2004 to step on her mat for the first time. It was an instant love affair. It's that same thirst that perpetuates her continuing education in the vast realm of yoga.</p>
			 
			<p>February 2008, life changed dramatically for Jana after a fun day snowboarding ended with a stretcher ride off the mountain followed by a 10-day hospital visit. Surgery was needed to repair her <span>broken back</span>. During her recovery, yoga transformed from an escape from her day job, to the very essence of this ancient practice: a potent tool for healing.</p>
			 
			<p>All the 'stuff' she had been studying, practicing and sharing through her practice of teaching yoga and meditation got put to the test this past summer when her father's battle with cancer turned terminal. She was able to reorganize her life to be with her family during the final three months of his life. To witness her father take his last breath and all the precious moments leading up to that final exhale confirmed what she thought all along: <span>This entire practice is preparing us for the moment we each find ourselves in that same great transition</span>.</p>
			 
			<p>Jana's biggest teacher remains to be the human experience itself, for as she embraces each and every moment more fully, every second becomes an opportunity to love more freely and grow. She swears the greatest way to integrate the teachings of yoga is to be present to your own laboratory: your own body and heart.</p> 
			 
			<p>As a facilitator of Gaiatri Yoga's <span>200 hour Yoga Alliance certified teacher trainings</span> and facilitator of her self designed <span>'Manifestation & Creation' workshops</span>, she inspires healthy, happy and harmonious living.</p>
