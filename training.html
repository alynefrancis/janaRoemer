				<p>At Gaiatri, we practice embodiment of ancient yogic teachings and call upon you to do the same. During this 200 hour YTT, you’ll do more than learn how to teach yoga, you’ll learn how to be yoga. This work will awaken a hunger to reflect & refine how you show up in your every day life. Live so your every thought, word and action is actualized with veracious integrity to know your essential self.​</p>

				<p>Gaiatri’s Yoga Teacher Training course in both Edmonton & Calgary consist of three modules and a retreat over a 5 month period.</p>

				<p>This incredibly rich program is steeped in the vast ocean of yogic principles and practices. Students can expect to be immersed in yoga asana, technique and alignment, breathing practices, meditation, personal coaching, voice and language training, leadership training, class management skills, human anatomy and studies in yoga philosophy.</p>

				<p>The yogic lifestyle is experientially woven in throughout the program as the student explores and develops their own personal teaching style and knowledge of yoga. Our experienced instructors work as sensitive and intuitive guides and utilize a hands-on approach while teaching and coaching the students to develop their personal yoga practice and teaching methodologies. Students are required to augment their daily learning with homework studies and reading.</p>
