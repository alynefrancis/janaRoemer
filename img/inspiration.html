<h1>Life is about learning to fall in love with everything.
How deep can you fall?</h1>

<p>You have been telling people that this is the Eleventh Hour, now you must go back and tell the people that this is the Hour.
 
And there are things to be considered. . . .​​​</p>
<ul>
	<li>Where are you living?</li>
	<li>What are you doing?</li>
	<li>What are your relationships?</li>
	<li>Are you in right relation?</li>
	<li>Where is your water?​​​</li>

	<li>Know your garden.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is time to speak your truth.
Create your community.
Be good to each other</p>

<h2>And do not look outside yourself for your leader.​</h2>
<p>Then he clasped his hands together, smiled, and said, "This could be a
good time! There is a river flowing now very fast. It is so great and
swift that there are those who will be afraid. They will try to hold on
to the shore. They will feel they are being torn apart and will suffer
greatly. Know the river has its destination. The elders say we must let
go of the shore, push off into the middle of the river, keep our eyes
open, and our heads above the water.​​​
And I say, see who is in there with you and celebrate. At this time in
history, we are to take nothing personally, least of all ourselves. For
the moment that we do, our spiritual growth and journey come to a halt.​​​
The time of the one wolf is over. Gather yourselves!
Banish the word 'struggle' from your attitude and your vocabulary. All
that we do now must be done in a sacred manner and in celebration</p>
