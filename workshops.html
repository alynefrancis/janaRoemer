			<p><strong>Manifestation & Creation. "Matrika Shakti" ~ How the words we choose create our reality.</strong></p>

			<p>Where is this workshop? Uma House, a private studio in Los Angeles, California.   *** Email jana.renee@gmail.com for details.</p>

			<p>This workshop will include techniques I've used over the years to design a dream-like life style and enables me to work and sustain life in unorthodox ways. I have used these practices to attract in the LOVE of my life, completely affordable & beautiful living arrangements and friends that fill me up in all the perfect ways. By understanding the power of the word & the 'art of allowing' -- doors have opened in places I didn't even know they existed, resistance to my fears have subsided and I've found more and more love in all the corners of my life.</p>

			<p>The best way this work showed up for me was when I was working to clear myself of debt. Using very clear thought & imagination processes, careful attention to the words I chose & a series of hints from the Universe, I ended up getting 6 out of 7 numbers right on a lotto max! The ticket paid out just $35 shy of my total debt load!</p>

			<p>This work is heavily influenced by Ester and Jerry Hicks' "Law of Attraction," a steady meditation practice, my father's forever reminder that "we are what we think about," and his constant encouragement and belief in my abilities to do whatever I put my mind to. You'll learn how to use imagination in a productive way and activate this ancient practice of yoga :: asana, pranayama, meditation.</p>
			
			<p>The techniques I will share with you will be rich and nutritious enough to keep you busy for the next year :: perhaps through out your whole life. I know for myself, I've been experimenting with these techniques for about a decade and they just keep revealing their magical ways.</p>
